# What you need to know about LARAVEL

   * Laravel Templating and UI Tools:
      *Blade (templating engine)* : A core part of Laravel.
      *Livewire (dynamic components without JavaScript)* :  A package that integrates tightly with Laravel, often considered part of the Laravel ecosystem, but technically it’s an external package.


   * If need interactions in frontend use:
      - Alpine: Alpine.js is a small JavaScript framework that `lets you add simple interactive` 
      |         features to  your HTML — like showing/hiding elements, toggling classes, or reacting to 
      |         user input — `without writing a lot of code`.
      - inertiajs: If the changes in frontend is really big use inertia.js
